thales
Tell me about a time you worked in a team environment. 
    group project building the nutrition tracking thing
    networking degree and i was the only one who could code
    was still able to distribute responsabilities, and helped them learn so they could contribute and pass the subject
    since it was a group project there was a possibility that one of us falling behind could reflect badly on the whole team

What interests you about an engineering job at a company like Thales?
    i believe the business that thales deals with aligns with my skillset and interests. I majored in network security, and while the lectures and coursework only touched on some IoT security issues, I found the operational technology case study listed on the website interesting as it listed activities that i may be able to apply my skills/knowledge to.  
    as someone who is also interested in software processes, thales is attractive to me as there are so many technical roles that there is a greater chance of there being a niche role that closely fits the diverse range of skills that I have.

Tell me a time where a person disagreed with your choices/decisions and how did you react. 
    three times:
        group project : girl in my group for an assignment about ethics kept telling me to write about office 365, because a person we interviewed went on a rant about it. i kept saying no because its not what we're supposed to be writing about. she asked me if i have a reason not to write about it, and that she said it was good. she was not happy that I rejected her suggestion, but she never really made a good argument.

        amazon  manager: told me to stop spending time on learning about the software process for our team and instead only focus on mastering operations. i wasn't happy about this, but I did what he said, even though i believed it was a bad idea. i believe i would have learned more about the internal tools that we used in operations if was contributing to projects that programmatically used the same tools, or if i was able to contribute to something that was to improve one  of those tools.

Give an example of when you have made a complex task simple.

Give an example of when you have solved a complex problem.

Give an example of when you have had to build rapport quickly.
    if possible the best way would be to figure out(or offer) some kind of synnergy between what my and the other persons work. e.g. with other employees who were relatively new, we would exchange howto's and knowledge when we needed it. this made it so we appreciated each other a lot. 
    otherwise you would figure out where you can offer help or support to a person. 

Give an example of when you have displayed leadership skills.
    when being briefed with other new people on an assignment or an issue and no one is asking questions, i begin asking questions and then other people are less afraid to ask their own questions to gain clarity. 


Give an example of when you have had to change direction in a project.
    i was doing a personal project using a frontend framework that is less popular and that i was not familiar with called vue. a lot of the importable color picker components were out of date and not compatible with the version of vue i was  using, even the one from the most popular vue component library. i ended up making my own color picker. This was a lot of work and I had to create it twice as the first time resulted in an abomination of code. but the pay off was that the result was a lot more customizable and was easier to troubleshoot because i understood how it worked from the inside.

Have you ever had difficulty working with someone.
    in the school group project mentioned above, one of the members would constantly make up stuff and put it in our reports/worded assignments. he didnt like it when i told him he shouldnt do that or when i replaced those sections. he became increasingly passive aggressive. i managed this by telling another team member what problems i was having, then it was more apparent to that person when the challenging member was rude to me during calls. he then helped me manage the communication with this person.

Describe a time when you had to resolve a conflict.
    1.
        when the girl who got her head smashed by her boyfriend came to the desk and demanded that i call an ambulence. she was crying and in a very emotional state. she tried to show me an injury, but i only saw hair. instead of calling an ambulence, i called the security control center and asked them to help me with the situation. they came down and took a closer look and found the injury and told me to call an ambulence. apparently what i did was wrong

    2.
        working as concierge/security at bottom of comission flats. there was a lengthy and nasty procedure to deal with tenants who lost their key, which was both hard for the concierge and them. because we were in a different building each week, it was hard to be familiar with who actually lived in the building.
        what made it worse was the book that had the names of who lived in there was physical and very outdated and therefore slow and unreliable. this also made many of the tenants dislike the security guards when the problem was not who was behind the glass.
        many conflicts happened as a result of this with the person saying they lived there and they need to get into their home.

        the best we could do about this, was try to keep them as calm as possible, also try to become familiar who lived in the building, and also figure out if they're going to tailgate in, we need to make judgements on whether they are a big threat and call security about it, because security was often busy with multiple buildings on a single estate.
    
        if someone looked unfamiliar or like they were on drugs trying to get in, we could call security control room where they could come down and help sus the person out. but what would have really solved that is if they just invested in some basic database system that was updated in realtime instead of using a physical book.
